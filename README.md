# supermemo_web_import

An AutoHotkey script for efficient importing from your browser to SuperMemo.

## Key Features

- **Quick Import**: Select text and press `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + A` to import to SuperMemo. Supports Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
- **Instant Import**: Use `Ctrl + Alt + A` for a quick import without the GUI.
- **Incremental Web Browsing**: Highlight text directly in the browser with `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + B`. Requires a highlighter plugin with the highlight shortcut set to `Shift + Alt + H`.
- **Formatted Imports**: Cleans up text formatting and includes references (title and link). For certain websites (e.g., YouTube), author and date are also included.

## Troubleshooting

- **Reload Script**: If something goes wrong (e.g., unable to retrieve the current page's URL), right-click the AHK icon in the taskbar to reload the script. This often resolves issues.
- **Dependencies**: The script depends on the UIA library and may not always function perfectly. Reloading usually fixes most problems.

## Future Enhancements

- Add detailed instructions for video and "online element" imports.
- Create a tutorial video for the above features, as they require extra preparations in SuperMemo.
